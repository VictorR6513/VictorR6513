## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Victor Rivera and I'm majoring in Data Science at NCC. I plan to transfer to a four year college to earn a bachelors degree and make a career off of what I love doing.
I'm interested in learning the coding and knowing what every bit of the code does and how it works to operate the output of the system. I've learned another computer language which was Java.
I'm currently working on doing work for my other classes but outside of that, I've been learning how to play the piano as it is one of my favorite things to do.
I have a lot of favorite hobbies but some are playing video games, playing sports with friends, working out, being outside, reading, and meditating.
